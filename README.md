# Kenyan-FinanceAnalysis
The project is about the Analysis of  Finances of Kenya with a given dataset and Existing Companies as well as Institutions.I carried out an analysis of the financial status of the country based on a small selection of the dataset. I have the data of the Loans, Credits and the Investments made on the specific dates: who the borrowers are, the amount of money used, which investments made, and the interest rates of revenue  and the most profitable institutions to the Nation. My main job is to analyze the money in th country  and determine where Loans and Investments are done.

The Project has the three dataset files

I used Python and SQL for Analysis and Tableau and Streamlit for Vizualisation.
