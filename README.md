# Kenyan-FinanceAnalysis
Origin of the Dataset : WORLD BANK DATA

The project is about the Analysis of  Finances of Kenya with a given dataset and Existing Companies as well as Institutions.I carried out an analysis of the financial status of the country based on a small selection of the dataset. I have the data of the Loans, Credits and the Investments made on the specific dates: who the borrowers are, the amount of money used, which investments made, and the interest rates of revenue  and the most profitable institutions to the Nation. My main job is to analyze the money in th country  and determine where Loans and Investments are done.

The aim of this analysis was to find the trends of what loans and credits were supposed to be paid and the major investments and the timlines of the Kenyan Nation. Another aim of the analysis of the dataset was to find the losses and where borrowed money is used and also what major investments take most money.

The Project has the three dataset files

I used Python and SQL for Analysis and Tableau and Streamlit for Vizualisation.
